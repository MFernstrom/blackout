# Blackout

Multi-monitor gaming utility - Blanks out chosen displays when games you choose runs

## How to use
1. Click Add
2. Select the executable to monitor
3. Choose monitors to blank out
4. Save
5. Start Monitoring

When minimized it's available in the tray next to the clock

## How does it work
Every 5 seconds it scans the running processes to check if it needs to blank out or un-blank out any monitors.

### Why
I play games on the same multi-monitor setup I use for programming, but the games I play aren't set up to run on multiple monitors, so they just sat there showing my desktop.

Not only was it distracting but they're also quite bright. I started turning them off, but that makes the computer go bonkers for a bit re-fitting every window from 3 monitors onto 1, and then when I'm done I had to move everything around again after turning them on.

So I got the idea of creating a utility that has the same effect but isn't a PITA. So Blackout was born.

Technically it overlays the chosen monitors with full-screen forms, set to a black background color, and set to Stay On Top.

I've been using it with a handful of games quite nicely so I figured it's time to share this little utility with the world.
